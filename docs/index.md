## Introduction

* The purpose of this datasheet is to outline the functionality of the power/energy consumption requirement of Spark Guard, a smart plug with multiple AC outlets and USB charging ports, all individually monitored and controlled for home automation and accurate power monitoring. 

### Project Summary

* Spark Guard is intended to provide a safe, secure, and indoors/outdoors use smart power strip with less connectivity issues. Along with these requirements power monitoring is important. For this design we've decided to have a display on the device itself that shows each USB port and AC outlet's energy consumption over time. The user will also be able to switch between power and energy use display.
